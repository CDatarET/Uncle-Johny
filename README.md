CodeChef Difficulty 1093 Problem.

ðŸŽµ Uncle Johny
Vlad enjoys listening to music. A few days ago, he had a birthday, and his parents gifted him an MP3 player! Now he can listen to his favorite songs whenever he wants.

Vlad created his own playlist consisting of N songs, each with a unique positive integer length. He likes all the songs, but there's one special song called "Uncle Johny" that he loves the most.

After creating the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. You are given the original playlist and the position of Uncle Johny before sorting. Your task is to determine the new position of Uncle Johny after sorting the playlist.

ðŸ“¥ Input
The first line contains an integer T â€” the number of test cases.

For each test case:

The first line contains an integer N â€” the number of songs in the playlist.

The second line contains N space-separated integers â€” the lengths of the songs.

The third line contains a single integer K â€” the position of Uncle Johny in the original (unsorted) playlist (1-based index).

ðŸ“¤ Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the 1-based position of "Uncle Johny" in the sorted playlist.
